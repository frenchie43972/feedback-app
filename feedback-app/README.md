This is a simple React application that allows users to leave generic feedback with a five point rating system.

It will count how many reviews there are and provide the average rating score.

You are able to add, edit and delete ratings and they are all saved to a json file.

This is from a Udemy course called. "React Fron to Back" by Brad Traversy
